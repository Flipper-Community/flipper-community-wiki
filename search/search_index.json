For this reason, the Flipper Zero firmware conservatively limits the transmitter to 56 kHz via <code>INFRARED_MAX_FREQUENCY</code>. There is no notable hardware risk if one desires to change this value, so long as it is understood that higher values are not guaranteed to be accurate in transmission timings for all scenarios.

Then on your Flipper Zero, use the file browser and go inside the folder to run the <code>update</code> file within the <code>f7-update-local/</code> folder you copied over.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Congratulations! You have now built and installed your own firmware!</p> <p>Protips</p> <ul> <li>If you want a more streamlined way of updating your firmware changes, you can use <code>./fbt flash_usb_full</code> to build AND install the firmware to the device all in one go!</li> <li>To clear out build files and ensure you have a clean build directory if you make changes or want to switch versions, run <code>./fbt -c</code> to remove any old build files. Then build the firmware as normal.</li> <li>If you have no idea what you were doing and want to undo ALL changes made since the last commit as well as delete any random files not tracked by git, you can these commands in order: <code>git clean -dxf</code> &amp; <code>git reset --hard</code> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/beginner_guide_fw/guide/#building-your-first-application","title":"Building Your First Application","text":"<p>This part of the guide assumes that you were able to complete the above steps for the firmware build successfully.</p> <p>Similar to building firmware, applications can be built using the Flipper Build Tool as well. Additionally, Flipper Zero applications must be built for the same firmware version your Flipper Zero has installed. </p> <p>To demonstrate building an application, we will use the Fortune Cookie app.</p> <ol> <li>In your <code>Flipperzero-firmware</code> directory, there should be a folder called <code>applications_user</code>, this is the folder we will be placing apps we want to build into. </li> <li><code>cd</code> into this directory.</li> <li>Run <code>git clone https://github.com/evillero/fortune_cookie.git</code> to copy down the fortune cookie app. You should now have a folder called <code>fortune_cookie</code> in your <code>applications_user</code> directory.</li> <li>Inside that folder, open up the <code>application.fam</code> file in your text editor of choice. Note the category name after <code>fap_category</code>, in this case <code>Games</code>. We will need this info for later. You may close your text editor out.</li> <li><code>cd</code> back to your <code>flipperzero-firmware</code> directory. </li> <li>Run <code>./fbt fap_dist</code> to build the code of all apps in the <code>applications_user</code> directory. </li> <li>Assuming fbt did not report any errors, the app should now be built<ul> <li>If you did hit errors, you'll need to contact the application author and ask them to fix it, or fix it yourself. As of v1.1.2 the Flipper Zero does not have a stable API, so applications can break with each update.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Go in to the <code>dist/F7-D/</code> directory. You will notice a new <code>apps/</code> folder here. Go into this folder</li> <li>Remembering the <code>fap_category</code> value from the prior steps was <code>Games</code> from our notes earlier, we now know that we can go into the <code>Games</code> folder thats inside the <code>apps</code> folder.</li> <li>Here you will find <code>fortune_cookie.fap</code> as well as any other items categorized as games. These are ready to use.</li> <li>Open up qFlipper or Flipper lab, and copy <code>fortune_cookie.fap</code> into <code>SD Card/apps/Games</code>, creating the <code>Games</code> folder if you do not have one. </li> <li>On your Flipper Zero, go to Apps -&gt; Games, and your Fortune cookie app should be there. Simply click it and run it!</li> </ol> <p>Protip</p> <p>If you grab the <code>appid</code> from the <code>application.fam</code> file, you can build, upload, and launch this app to the Flipper Zero all in one step! Simply do <code>./fbt launch APPSRC=fortune_cookie</code></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/f0_fonts_guide/guide/","title":"How to create custom fonts for the Flipper Zero","text":"<p>Guide credited to EntranceJew</p> <p>\"I spent two days trying to do this mess so you're going to learn something.\"</p> <p>This guide aims to show how a custom font can be created for the Flipper Zero, with Microsoft Windows as the OS used.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/f0_fonts_guide/guide/#pixelfont","title":"Pixelfont","text":"<p>Download and open pixelfont in your browser </p> <p>Before you import your image, really study how this is laid out, the default example is really helpful on how you should plan to draw your own font.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/f0_fonts_guide/guide/#aesprite-your-font","title":"Aesprite your font","text":"<p>This part is painful.</p> <ol> <li>Find find your largest character, make sure each letter of your font is on a grid with an equal amount of room as that one.</li> <li>If you have a baseline, be sure to account for that with your tile size in regards to how each character is positioned within the tile.</li> <li>You can work with layers or tags but most auto-tools are going to expect a long \"tile sheet\" where each character is visible in rows/columns of equal size.</li> <li>Make sure to set up your grid to help you out:</li> </ol> <p></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/f0_fonts_guide/guide/#back-to-pixelfont","title":"Back to pixelfont","text":"<ol> <li>Pick an image (your export from aesprite)</li> <li>Type out the glyphs in the image in the order they appear<ul> <li>NOTE: save this somewhere, we're going to want to have this later!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Set the <code>tile width</code> / <code>tile height</code> to match the largest character</li> <li>Adjust the baseline to be <code>the height of your pixel font</code> as your starting point:<ol> <li>If all your characters are equally tall (reach the top and bottom) then you don't need to do anything</li> <li>If you have characters that are like a lowercase \"y\" which is 2 pixels lower than every other character / the only one that touches the bottom of its tile, then make this box equal to the height of a tile minus the distance between a regular letter's bottom (like <code>h</code>) to the tile's bottom. </li> <li>If your font was 5 pixels tall, but your y goes 2 pixels lower than every other character, then you'd type 3 here</li> </ol> </li> <li>If you set up kerning pairs then you probably don't want to click <code>Monospace</code> </li> <li>If there is a reason to change anything on the output page, I do not know it.</li> <li>Fill out your Meta page, then hit <code>Save TTF</code></li> </ol>"},{"location":"tutorials/f0_fonts_guide/guide/#fontforge-cleanup","title":"FontForge cleanup","text":"<p>This part was mostly cited from https://github.com/projectitis/packedbdf/blob/master/README.md verbatim but I had to change a few parts in order to make it accurate for me, on windows, trying to make fonts for the Flipper Zero.</p> <ol> <li>Download and install Font Forge</li> <li>Launch Font Forge and open the font file (ttf tends to keep kerning pairs better?)</li> <li>Edit &gt; Select &gt; Glyphs Worth Outputting <ol> <li>You can do Element &gt; Overlap &gt; Remove Overlap at this stage to simplify the geometry of your pixel font.</li> <li>Other Validation steps may impact your font if you set up kerning pairs in the pixelfont tool, it relies on boundaries being set up a specific way with the font so fixing \"declared widths\" may cause more problems for you.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>It is recommended you remove Glyphs you have no concern with, you can do this via the following:</p> <ol> <li>Edit &gt; Select &gt; Invert the selection (to select the glyphs you don't want to keep), and</li> <li>Encoding &gt; Detach and remove Glyphs to remove them from the font<ul> <li>This might not work if you have something invalid in your selection, like something you can't remove.</li> </ul> </li> <li>You can check what is still inside your font if you select Encoding &gt; Compact to reduce the character set, but I recommend turning it back off prior to generating fonts.</li> </ol> <p>The next few steps will generate the bitmaps/pixel versions of each glyph in the sizes that you need:</p> <ol> <li>Element &gt; Bitmap strikes available launches the dialog to generate the bitmap versions<ol> <li>Select <code>Win</code>,</li> <li>Type in the pixel height of a single character of your font in the <code>Point sizes on a 120 dpi screen</code> <ul> <li>e.g. <code>5</code> will automatically populate into =&gt; <code>Pixel Sizes: 8</code></li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li> <li>Click [OK] to generate the bitmap strikes of each glyph in various sizes</li> <li>Finally, select File &gt; Generate Fonts<ul> <li>Select \"No outline font\" (for Outline font) and \"BDF\" (for Bitmap font), then hit [Generate].</li> <li>Enter 120dpi as the screen resolution (also see step 7).
