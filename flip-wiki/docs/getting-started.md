## What To Do After Getting Your Flipper Zero

- <H1>[**Read the official docs!**](https://docs.flipper.net)</H1>
    - **Seriously**, Read them!
    - Have we mentioned how ***great*** they are?!
    - Do you know how ***cool*** reading them makes you?!

## What Not To Do

### Do Not Try Copying a Car Remote/Keyfob
!!! Warning
    Attempting this anyway can lead to a VERY expensive mistake!

Car remotes use rolling code to prevent copying. Any attempts may cause the remote to desync, requiring an expensive trip to the dealer to fix your remote. 

See the [FAQ on this](faq-general.md#can-flipper-zero-copy-car-remotes) for more info.
