## What Not To Do

### Do Not Try Copying a Car Remote/Keyfob
!!! Warning
    Attempting this anyway can lead to a VERY expensive mistake!

Car remotes use rolling code to prevent copying. Any attempts may cause the remote to desync, requiring an expensive trip to the dealer to fix your remote. 

See the [FAQ on this](faq-general.md#can-flipper-zero-copy-car-remotes) for more info. 

### Do Not Downgrade Below 1.1.2
If you have updated your Flipper Zero to version 1.1.2, do not try downgrading later to an older version unless you know what you are doing. 
Changes have been made that can now cause weirdness on previous firmware versions. See [this page for more info](troubleshooting.md#after-firmware-downgrade-the-battery-status-does-not-work)
