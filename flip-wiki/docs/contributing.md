# Contributing To The Wiki

## Guidelines
The following guidelines should be kept in mind when submitting changes:

- This wiki may grow to support other Flipper items beyond just the Flipper zero, so be precise about which device you reference. 
- Our audience is international based, so use clear and precise language, avoiding slang or acronyms without explanation.
- Do not provide guides to facilitate illegal activity or custom device firmwares that allow the enablement of illegal activity
    - This includes but is not restricted to: jamming, illegal radio transmitting, defeating regional frequency locks, and fraud
- Keep your writing tone non-biased and professional.
