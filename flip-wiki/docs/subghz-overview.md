# Flipper Zero Sub-GHz Overview
The Flipper Zero, according to the [official documentation](https://docs.flipper.net/sub-ghz#kfpN7), has the following hardware setup: 

> Flipper Zero has a built-in sub-1 GHz module based on a [CC1101 transceiver](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cc1101.pdf) and a radio antenna (the maximum range is 50 meters). Both the CC1101 chip and the antenna are designed to operate at frequencies in the 300-348 MHz, 387-464 MHz, and 779-928 MHz bands.

Upon your first firmware update, the associated official app used to update your Flipper Zero will automatically set your region. By doing so, the device will automatically prevent you from transmitting on frequencies that civilians do not have a license for. This by extension will prevent you from accidentally interfering with radio items such as emergency services, aircraft transmissions, or other items used by the government. It will also automatically set the appropriate transmit strength for your country so that you avoid any legal penalties for high powered transmitting.

## Sub-GHz File Formats
The file formats for the files generated by the Sub-GHz system are detailed on the [FlipperZero-Firmware GitHub documentation](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation%2Ffile_formats%2FSubGhzFileFormats.md).

As the standard RAW preset is a little unusual to look at, it has additionally been detailed below. 

### Standard RAW Preset
The standard RAW format file, as detailed in the earlier mentioned documentation, is an array of timings in microseconds. The `+` and `-` symbols represent high and low states for the data transmitted. Values must start with a positive value, then switch between high and low states. a single `RAW_Data:` line can have no more than 512 timings total. However, multiple `RAW_Data:` lines can exist in the `.sub` file.

To describe this more directly, lets say we have this sample raw recording of some short signal:

`RAW_Data: 100 -100 200 -200`

You would have the following information in order:

- 100 microseconds HIGH
- 100 microseconds LOW
- 200 microseconds HIGH
- 200 microseconds LOW

Flipper Lab contains a [pulse plotter](https://lab.flipper.net/pulse-plotter) that can be used to more easily visualize these raw recordings.
