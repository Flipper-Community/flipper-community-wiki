# Arcade Data Cards
If you are after *Sega Aime Card* or *Bandai Namco Passport* access keys, then they are included in the system dictionary as of OFW 0.98.2; you may want to copy/paste them into your user dictionary *if you frequently find yourself using those access keys*.

The Flipper Zero has expanded its *FeliCa* emulation support as of OFW 0.103.1; however, *Bandai Namco Passport* readers do not recognise the emulated AmIC Card and *Sega Aime* readers fail to read the AmiC Card**.
# Arcade Payment Cards
If you are wanting to emulate your cashless pre-paid arcade payment card, then please check whether your arcade uses *Embed*; if they do, they may already have the *MobileWallet* module provisioned, meaning you may be able to legitimately add it to your *Apple Wallet* / *Google Wallet* via the arcade's Member Portal *provided your phone/watch/device is able to emulate NFC cards*.

If your arcade otherwise uses *InterCard*, *Sacoa*, *Amusement Connect*, *Semnox*, *RFPay*, or another cashless arcade payment system, then

**You __should not__ be using your Flipper Zero to emulate your arcade payment card.**
