# Javascript on the Flipper Zero
The Flipper Zero supports a stripped down version of Javascript [based on MJS](https://github.com/cesanta/mjs) for more advanced scripting and control of other modules provided by apps on the Flipper Zero. Currently, this is largely limited to GUI and BadUSB automation modules. 

The official javascript development documentation can be located [here](https://developer.flipper.net/flipperzero/doxygen/js.html).
